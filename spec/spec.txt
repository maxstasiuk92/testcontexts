----Assemble context----
* mandatory! specify class-path with frameworks
* enum classes, packages
* which beans should be replaced by supplied objects
    - supplied should have scope=singleton or be cloneable
* allow to deploy to embedded tomcat
* contexts are created in separate threads
    - provide methods for synchronization
    - thread should not die right after creation

----Settings for test----
@ContextConfiguration: v1
@ActiveProfiles: v1
@TestPropertySource: v1
@RecordApplicationEvents
@Commit
@Rollback
@BeforeTransaction
@AfterTransaction

Potential settings for test
@DynamicPropertySource
@WebAppConfiguration
@ContextHierarchy
@TestExecutionListeners
@Sql
@SqlConfig
@SqlMergeMode
@SqlGroup

----Questions----
Should contexts be beans? Will @DirtiesContext have any sense?
Some configurations require spring's classes, how to deal with this?

About classloaders
difference in interaction of system with parallel capable and not parallel capable CL?
meaning of fields:
    parallelLockMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    package2certs = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    assertionLock = new Object();
Ans: In static block. ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable - when to invoke?
how to sync. on CL and class name?
how to Process modules?

Info/limitations
allow to create classloaders
same System properties for all
same java api for all - java version in test should be greater, than in microservices
